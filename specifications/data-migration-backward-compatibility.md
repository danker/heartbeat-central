# Specification: Data Migration & Backward Compatibility

## Overview
Ensure safe migration from the old healthcheck system to the new heartbeat system while maintaining data integrity and providing rollback capabilities.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Preserve historical alert configurations during migration
- Maintain audit trail of all data transformations
- Provide rollback mechanism to previous system state
- Support parallel operation during transition period

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Zero-downtime migration process
- Data integrity validation at each migration step
- Performance impact minimal during migration
- Complete migration within maintenance window

## Technical Design
### Architecture
Implement a phased migration approach with validation checkpoints and rollback capabilities integrated into the existing Flask application architecture.

### Components
- Migration orchestrator: Coordinates the entire migration process
- Data validator: Ensures data integrity at each step
- Rollback manager: Handles reverting to previous state if needed
- Backup manager: Creates and manages data backups

### Data Model
```python
class MigrationLog(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    migration_step = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    status = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)  # pending, completed, failed
    started_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False)
    completed_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=True)
    error_message = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    rollback_data = db.Column(db.JSON, nullable=True)
```

### API Design
- POST /api/migration/start - Begin migration process
- GET /api/migration/status - Check migration progress
- POST /api/migration/rollback - Rollback to previous state
- GET /api/migration/validate - Validate migrated data

## Implementation Details
### Files to Modify
- `models.py`: Add MigrationLog model
- `database.py`: Add migration utilities
- `routes.py`: Add migration API endpoints

### New Files
- `migration_manager.py`: Core migration logic
- `data_validator.py`: Data integrity validation
- `migrations/`: Directory for migration scripts

### Dependencies
- No new external dependencies required
- Leverage existing SQLAlchemy migration capabilities

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- Test each migration step individually
- Test rollback functionality
- Test data validation logic

### Integration Tests
- Full migration process with sample data
- Rollback scenarios with various failure points
- Performance testing with large datasets

### Manual Testing
- Migration dry-run on production copy
- Alert configuration verification
- Historical data integrity checks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All existing alert configurations preserved
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] Rollback capability verified and tested
- [ ] Migration completes within 30 minutes
- [ ] All tests pass post-migration
- [ ] Documentation updated with migration procedures

## Open Questions
- Should we maintain old healthcheck tables for historical reference?
- What is the acceptable downtime window for migration?
- How long should we retain rollback data?
