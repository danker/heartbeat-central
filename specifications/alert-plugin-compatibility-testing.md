# Specification: Alert Plugin Compatibility Testing

## Overview
Ensure all existing alert plugins (email, Slack, Discord, SMS) work correctly with the new heartbeat monitoring system and Application model structure.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- All alert plugins send notifications for missed heartbeats
- Recovery alerts work when heartbeats resume
- Alert content includes relevant heartbeat-specific information
- Plugin configuration remains compatible with existing setups
- Rate limiting prevents alert spam during outages

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Alert delivery within 30 seconds of detection
- Plugin failure doesn't affect other alert channels
- Graceful degradation when external services unavailable
- Memory usage stable during high alert volumes

## Technical Design
### Architecture
Build comprehensive test suite around the existing AlertManager architecture, focusing on the mock object compatibility layer and plugin integration.

### Components
- Plugin test harness: Automated testing framework for all plugins
- Mock service simulator: Simulates external alert services
- Load test generator: Creates high-volume alert scenarios
- Configuration validator: Ensures plugin configs work correctly

### Data Model
Test data structures for plugin compatibility:
```python
# Test scenarios
test_scenarios = [
    {
        'application': Application(...),
        'alert_type': 'failure',
        'expected_fields': ['name', 'uuid', 'last_heartbeat'],
        'plugin_configs': {...}
    }
]
```

### API Design
- POST /api/test/alerts/{plugin_type} - Test specific plugin
- GET /api/test/alerts/status - Overall plugin health
- POST /api/test/alerts/load - Load testing endpoint

## Implementation Details
### Files to Modify
- `alert_manager.py`: Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- `tests/test_alerts.py`: Expand alert plugin test coverage
- `alert_plugins/base_plugin.py`: Add base test utilities

### New Files
- `tests/test_alert_plugins.py`: Comprehensive plugin testing
- `tests/fixtures/alert_scenarios.py`: Test data scenarios
- `tools/alert_test_harness.py`: Manual testing tool
- `tests/integration/test_alert_integration.py`: End-to-end tests

### Dependencies
- `responses` library for mocking HTTP calls
- `pytest-mock` for advanced mocking capabilities
- `factory-boy` for test data generation

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- Each plugin handles heartbeat alerts correctly
- Mock object creation works for all scenarios
- Error handling for plugin failures
- Configuration validation for each plugin type

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end alert flow from heartbeat miss to notification
- Multiple plugins sending simultaneous alerts
- Plugin failure isolation (one plugin fails, others continue)
- Rate limiting during alert storms

### Manual Testing
- Real alert delivery to actual services (Slack, Discord, etc.)
- Alert content verification in each channel
- Performance testing with high alert volumes
- Configuration testing with various setups

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 4 alert plugins successfully send heartbeat failure alerts
- [ ] Recovery alerts work correctly for all plugins
- [ ] Alert content includes application name, UUID, and last heartbeat
- [ ] Plugin failures don't affect other alert channels
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents duplicate alerts within 5 minutes
- [ ] Test coverage above 90% for alert-related code
- [ ] Load testing handles 100+ simultaneous alerts
- [ ] Documentation updated with heartbeat alert examples

## Open Questions
- Should we add new heartbeat-specific alert templates?
- How should we handle partial plugin failures (e.g., some recipients fail)?
- What's the appropriate rate limiting window for heartbeat alerts?
