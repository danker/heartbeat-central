# Specifications Directory

This directory contains detailed specifications for features and components before implementation.

## Purpose

Creating specifications before coding helps:
- Clarify requirements and design decisions
- Identify potential issues early
- Provide clear implementation guidance
- Serve as documentation for future reference
- Enable review and feedback before writing code

## Process

1. **Create a new specification**
   - Copy `TEMPLATE.md` to a new file: `[feature-name].md`
   - Or use the `/new-spec` command in Claude Code
   
2. **Fill out the specification**
   - Complete all relevant sections
   - Be as detailed as possible
   - Include diagrams if helpful
   
3. **Review the specification**
   - Share with team members or stakeholders
   - Iterate based on feedback
   - Mark open questions as resolved
   
4. **Implement based on the specification**
   - Use the spec as your implementation guide
   - Update the spec if requirements change
   - Check off acceptance criteria as completed

## Naming Convention

Specification files should be named: `[feature-name].md`

Examples:
- `user-authentication.md`
- `webhook-integration.md`
- `performance-optimization.md`

## Tips for Good Specifications

- Be specific about edge cases
- Include error handling requirements
- Consider backwards compatibility
- Define clear success metrics
- Document any assumptions made
