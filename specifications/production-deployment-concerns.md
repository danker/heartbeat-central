# Specification: Production Deployment Concerns

## Overview
Address production deployment considerations for the heartbeat monitoring system, including Docker configuration, environment variables, health checks, and deployment strategies.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Zero-downtime deployment capability
- Health check endpoints for load balancers
- Graceful shutdown handling for background services
- Database connection pooling and retry logic
- Configurable logging levels and output formats

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Container startup time under 30 seconds
- Memory usage stable under load
- CPU usage efficient for background monitoring
- Network resilience during connectivity issues
- Disk space management for logs and database

## Technical Design
### Architecture
Enhance the existing Flask application with production-ready features including proper signal handling, health checks, and monitoring integration.

### Components
- Health check service: Advanced health monitoring beyond basic endpoint
- Graceful shutdown handler: Proper cleanup of background services
- Connection pool manager: Database connection optimization
- Metrics collector: Application performance monitoring
- Log formatter: Structured logging for production

### Data Model
Add operational tables for production monitoring:
```python
class HealthMetrics(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable=False)
    metric_name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    metric_value = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    tags = db.Column(db.JSON, nullable=True)
```

### API Design
- GET /health/ready - Readiness probe for Kubernetes
- GET /health/live - Liveness probe for Kubernetes
- GET /metrics - Prometheus-compatible metrics
- POST /admin/shutdown - Graceful shutdown trigger

## Implementation Details
### Files to Modify
- `app.py`: Add signal handlers and graceful shutdown
- `Dockerfile`: Optimize for production deployment
- `docker-compose.yml`: Production-ready compose configuration
- `requirements.txt`: Add production dependencies
- `routes.py`: Enhanced health check endpoints

### New Files
- `config/production.py`: Production-specific configuration
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: Deployment automation script
- `k8s/`: Kubernetes deployment manifests
- `monitoring/`: Prometheus and Grafana configurations
- `logs/logrotate.conf`: Log rotation configuration

### Dependencies
- `gunicorn`: Production WSGI server
- `prometheus-client`: Metrics collection
- `structlog`: Structured logging
- `psycopg2`: PostgreSQL adapter for production

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- Signal handler behavior
- Health check endpoint responses
- Configuration loading from environment
- Graceful shutdown procedures

### Integration Tests
- Full deployment process simulation
- Database connection resilience
- Load balancer health check integration
- Container orchestration compatibility

### Manual Testing
- Production deployment dry run
- Load testing under production conditions
- Failover and recovery scenarios
- Monitoring and alerting validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment achieved
- [ ] Health checks work with load balancers
- [ ] Graceful shutdown completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Application handles database connection failures
- [ ] Structured logging captures all important events
- [ ] Metrics available for monitoring systems
- [ ] Container images optimized for size and security
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests ready for production use

## Open Questions
- Should we use Redis for session storage in production?
- What's the optimal database connection pool size?
- How should we handle database migrations in production?
- What monitoring metrics are most important to track?
