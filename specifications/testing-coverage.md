# Specification: Testing Coverage

## Overview
Expand test coverage for the heartbeat monitoring system to ensure comprehensive validation of all functionality, edge cases, and integration scenarios.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Unit test coverage above 90% for all modules
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for scalability validation
- Security tests for vulnerability detection

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Test suite completes in under 5 minutes
- Tests run reliably in CI/CD pipeline
- Test data isolation between test runs
- Comprehensive test reporting and metrics
- Easy test execution for developers

## Technical Design
### Architecture
Implement comprehensive testing strategy with multiple test types using pytest framework and appropriate testing utilities.

### Components
- Unit test suite: Individual component testing
- Integration test suite: API and service integration
- End-to-end test suite: Complete workflow validation
- Performance test suite: Load and stress testing
- Security test suite: Vulnerability and penetration testing

### Data Model
Test data management and fixtures:
```python
# Test fixtures for consistent data
@pytest.fixture
def sample_application():
    return Application(
        name="Test App",
        expected_interval=300,
        grace_period=30
    )

@pytest.fixture
def sample_heartbeat_events(sample_application):
    return [
        HeartbeatEvent(
            application_id=sample_application.id,
            received_at=datetime.now() - timedelta(minutes=i)
        ) for i in range(10)
    ]
```

### API Design
Test coverage for all endpoints:
- POST /heartbeat/{uuid} - Heartbeat processing
- GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/applications - Application management
- GET /api/applications/{id}/heartbeats - Heartbeat history
- GET /health - Health check endpoints

## Implementation Details

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- All model methods and properties
- Service layer business logic
- Utility functions and helpers
- Error handling and edge cases
- Data validation and serialization

### Integration Tests
- Database operations and queries
- API endpoint request/response cycles
- Background service functionality
- Alert plugin integration
- External service interactions

### Manual Testing
- User interface functionality
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsive design
- Real-world scenario validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test coverage above 90% for all modules
- [ ] Integration tests cover all API endpoints
- [ ] End-to-end tests validate critical workflows
- [ ] Performance tests validate scalability requirements
- [ ] Security tests check for common vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test suite runs in under 5 minutes
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline includes all test types
- [ ] Test reports provide actionable metrics

## Open Questions
- Should we implement visual regression testing for the dashboard?
- What's the appropriate balance between unit and integration tests?
- How should we handle flaky tests in the CI pipeline?
- Should we implement mutation testing for test quality validation?
