# Specification: Monitoring & Observability

## Overview
Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability for the heartbeat monitoring system to ensure operational visibility, performance tracking, and proactive issue detection.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Application performance metrics collection
- Custom business metrics for heartbeat monitoring
- Distributed tracing for request flows
- Log aggregation and structured logging
- Health check endpoints for infrastructure monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Metrics collection overhead under 5% CPU
- Log retention configurable by environment
- Monitoring data available in real-time
- Dashboard response time under 2 seconds
- Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure

## Technical Design
### Architecture
Implement observability stack using industry-standard tools integrated with the Flask application through middleware and instrumentation.

### Components
- Metrics collector: Application and business metrics
- Trace collector: Request tracing and performance
- Log aggregator: Centralized logging with correlation
- Dashboard system: Visualization and alerting
- Health checker: Deep application health monitoring

### Data Model
Monitoring data structures:
```python
# Metrics to collect
metrics = {
    'heartbeat_received_total': Counter,
    'heartbeat_processing_duration': Histogram,
    'application_overdue_count': Gauge,
    'alert_sent_total': Counter,
    'database_connection_pool_size': Gauge,
    'background_service_health': Gauge
}

# Trace spans
span_names = [
    'heartbeat.process',
    'database.query',
    'alert.send',
    'application.check_status'
]
```

### API Design
- GET /metrics - Prometheus-format metrics
- GET /health/detailed - Comprehensive health status
- GET /api/monitoring/dashboard - Dashboard data
- POST /api/monitoring/trace - Custom trace events

## Implementation Details
### Files to Modify
- `app.py`: Add monitoring middleware and instrumentation
- `routes.py`: Add trace decorators and metric collection
- `heartbeat_monitor.py`: Add monitoring for background service
- `alert_manager.py`: Add alert delivery metrics
- `database.py`: Add database performance monitoring

### New Files
- `monitoring/metrics.py`: Custom metrics definitions
- `monitoring/tracing.py`: Distributed tracing setup
- `monitoring/logging.py`: Structured logging configuration
- `monitoring/health.py`: Advanced health check logic
- `dashboards/grafana/`: Grafana dashboard definitions
- `config/prometheus.yml`: Prometheus configuration

### Dependencies
- `prometheus-client`: Metrics collection
- `opentelemetry-api`: Distributed tracing
- `structlog`: Structured logging
- `flask-opentracing`: Flask tracing integration
- `psutil`: System metrics collection

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- Metrics collection accuracy
- Trace span creation and completion
- Log formatting and correlation
- Health check response validation
- Monitoring overhead measurement

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end trace collection
- Metrics aggregation across requests
- Log correlation across services
- Dashboard data accuracy
- Alert generation from monitoring data

### Manual Testing
- Grafana dashboard functionality
- Prometheus metrics scraping
- Log aggregation in ELK/EFK stack
- Performance impact under load
- Alert notification testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All key business metrics collected and exposed
- [ ] Request tracing captures full heartbeat flow
- [ ] Structured logs include correlation IDs
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint responds quickly
- [ ] Grafana dashboards show real-time data
- [ ] Health checks provide detailed status information
- [ ] Monitoring overhead stays under 5% CPU
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring works

## Open Questions
- Should we use OpenTelemetry or simpler tracing solution?
- What's the optimal metrics retention period?
- How should we handle high-cardinality metrics?
- Should we implement custom alerting rules in the application?
