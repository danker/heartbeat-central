# Specification: Performance & Scalability

## Overview
Optimize the heartbeat monitoring system for high performance and horizontal scalability to handle thousands of applications sending frequent heartbeats.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Support 10,000+ applications sending heartbeats
- Handle 1000+ heartbeats per second
- Background monitoring completes within configured intervals
- Database queries optimized for large datasets
- Efficient memory usage under high load

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Heartbeat endpoint response time under 100ms
- Memory usage grows linearly with application count
- CPU utilization under 70% during peak load
- Database connection pool efficiency above 90%
- Horizontal scaling capability proven

## Technical Design
### Architecture
Implement performance optimizations and scalability patterns including connection pooling, caching, async processing, and database optimization.

### Components
- Connection pool manager: Optimized database connections
- Cache layer: Redis for frequently accessed data
- Async task queue: Background processing with Celery
- Database optimizer: Query optimization and indexing
- Load balancer: Distribution across multiple instances

### Data Model
Optimized database schema with proper indexing:
```sql
-- Key indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_application_uuid ON application(uuid);
CREATE INDEX idx_application_active ON application(is_active);
CREATE INDEX idx_heartbeat_app_time ON heartbeat_event(application_id, received_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_application_last_heartbeat ON application(last_heartbeat);

-- Partitioning for heartbeat_event table
CREATE TABLE heartbeat_event_202401 PARTITION OF heartbeat_event
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
```

### API Design
- Optimized heartbeat endpoint with minimal processing
- Batch API endpoints for bulk operations
- Caching headers for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing where possible

## Implementation Details
### Files to Modify
- `app.py`: Add connection pooling and caching configuration
- `routes.py`: Optimize heartbeat endpoint processing
- `heartbeat_monitor.py`: Add async processing and batching
- `database.py`: Add connection pool management
- `models.py`: Add database indexes and optimizations

### New Files
- `cache/redis_client.py`: Redis caching implementation
- `tasks/celery_app.py`: Async task processing
- `performance/profiling.py`: Performance monitoring tools
- `database/migrations/`: Performance optimization migrations
- `config/production_tuning.py`: Production performance settings

### Dependencies
- `redis`: Caching layer
- `celery`: Async task processing
- `psycopg2-pool`: PostgreSQL connection pooling
- `gunicorn`: Production WSGI server with worker tuning
- `sqlalchemy-utils`: Database optimization utilities

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Tests
- Database query performance with large datasets
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Connection pool efficiency
- Memory usage patterns
- Async task processing

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end performance under load
- Concurrent heartbeat processing
- Database performance with realistic data
- Cache invalidation scenarios
- Horizontal scaling validation

### Manual Testing
- Load testing with 10,000+ applications
- Stress testing heartbeat endpoint
- Memory profiling under sustained load
- Database performance monitoring
- Multi-instance deployment testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System handles 10,000 applications reliably
- [ ] Heartbeat endpoint responds in under 100ms
- [ ] 1000+ heartbeats per second processed successfully
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under load
- [ ] Database queries complete in under 50ms
- [ ] Horizontal scaling works with load balancer
- [ ] Cache hit ratio above 80% for frequent operations
- [ ] Background monitoring completes within intervals

## Open Questions
- Should we implement database read replicas for scaling?
- What's the optimal Redis cache eviction policy?
- How should we handle database partitioning for very large datasets?
- Should we implement application-level sharding?
